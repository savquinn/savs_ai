Don\u2019t give them my name because Shannon and Santiago are the ones who gave the gate permission to let you in.\n\n You must enter Indian Palms at the gate (48630 Monroe Street, Indio).\u00a0\u00a0Once through the gate your GPS will lead you to the house at 82703 Redford Way. You can also get a map from the gate attendant. Redford Way is in the newer part of Indian Palms. \n\nDue to the concerts, the front gate will be max out getting people in so please be patient. Once you are in and have a pass I believe they will allow you to enter and exit the Jackson street gate. That gate is to your left as you face the house. It is two stop signs down.\n\nHouse access:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Open front door using Schlage Code Entry: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad. Then type in 1967, electronic lock engages (clicks), however, you will need to manually turn the knob to release deadbolt. \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To lock front door using Schlage Code Entry System: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad, electronic lock engages (clicks), manually turn the knob to lock deadbolt. (please make sure, deadbolt engaged and door is locked) No need to use code to lock.\n\nWhen you enter the house there will be note book of house instructions in a basket on the entry table. In the basket are keys, a garage door opener and a remote for the patio lights. \nPlease make sure you put all of your trash in the cans on the garage\u00a0\u00a0side of the house. \n\nThere are cans for trash and recyclables. There are extra trash bags in the laundry room. Trash is picked up on Monday. Please put the cans with your trash on the sidewalk next to the fire hydrant. Make sure the recyclable large can is not over 70 lbs.\n\nThey are allowing overnight parking in the street for the concerts. You can park 2 cars in the garage and 2 in the drive so you should be good.\n\nThe pool will be heated to 85 degrees. Please don\u2019t turn the heat beyond 85 because it is very expensive to heat. The spa is set for 100 degrees. When you switch the heater to spa mode it takes about 45 minutes to heat. All of the operating instructions for the pool equipment is in the house instructions notebook. When you are through using the spa make sure you turn the values back to pool setting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you have any problems don't hesitate to call\u00a0\u00a0or text me Shannon or Santiago.\n\nWe have excellent neighbors but I would ask that you keep the noise level down when you return from the concert.\n\nYou can check in anytime after noon and please check out by noon on Monday.\n\nAbsolutely no glitter in the house or outside.

Your host will be Shannon and Santiago Mendez. When you get to the Indian Palms gate give your names and tell them you are guest of Shannon and Santiago Mendez, 82703 Redford Way. Don\u2019t give them my name because Shannon and Santiago are the ones who gave the gate permission to let you in.\n\n You must enter Indian Palms at the gate (48630 Monroe Street, Indio).\u00a0\u00a0Once through the gate your GPS will lead you to the house at 82703 Redford Way. You can also get a map from the gate attendant. Redford Way is in the newer part of Indian Palms. \n\nDue to the concerts, the front gate will be max out getting people in so please be patient. Once you are in and have a pass I believe they will allow you to enter and exit the Jackson street gate. That gate is to your left as you face the house. It is two stop signs down.\n\nHouse access:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Open front door using Schlage Code Entry: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad. Then type in 1967, electronic lock engages (clicks), however, you will need to manually turn the knob to release deadbolt. \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To lock front door using Schlage Code Entry System: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad, electronic lock engages (clicks), manually turn the knob to lock deadbolt. (please make sure, deadbolt engaged and door is locked) No need to use code to lock.\n\nWhen you enter the house there will be note book of house instructions in a basket on the entry table. In the basket are keys, a garage door opener and a remote for the patio lights. \nPlease make sure you put all of your trash in the cans on the garage\u00a0\u00a0side of the house. \n\nThere are cans for trash and recyclables. There are extra trash bags in the laundry room. Trash is picked up on Monday. Please put the cans with your trash on the sidewalk next to the fire hydrant. Make sure the recyclable large can is not over 70 lbs.\n\nThey are allowing overnight parking in the street for the concerts. You can park 2 cars in the garage and 2 in the drive so you should be good.\n\nThe pool will be heated to 85 degrees. Please don\u2019t turn the heat beyond 85 because it is very expensive to heat. The spa is set for 100 degrees. When you switch the heater to spa mode it takes about 45 minutes to heat. All of the operating instructions for the pool equipment is in the house instructions notebook. When you are through using the spa make sure you turn the values back to pool setting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you have any problems don't hesitate to call\u00a0\u00a0or text me Shannon or Santiago.\n\nWe have excellent neighbors but I would ask that you keep the noise level down when you return from the concert.\n\nYou can check in anytime after noon and please check out by noon on Monday.\n\nAbsolutely no glitter in the house or outside. We had a horrific experience two years ago with glitter and the cleaning cost were astronomical\n\nTHANK YOU for booking and have fun at Coachella! Let me know if you have any further questions. Text or call your host,\u00a0\u00a0Shannon Mendez \u2013 (858) 242-0811or Santiago Mendez \u2013 (858) 254-1337\n\nLarry"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sorry to dash early last night\u2014super fun times, and hope everyone had an easy return home today!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "And glad this was a hoax & not a reality, just saw in the news"}, {"role": "user", "content": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-14/he-told-casino-security-about-his-plans-to-bomb-coachella-he-was-arrested-hours-later"}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a happier note :)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Us at zeds dead \ud83d\ude02 LOCK IN"}, {"role": "user", "content": "https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8j5MWWq/"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I hit 30k what was the highest?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "45k - so close to walking a marathon!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "45!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "45 is insane"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\ud83e\udef6\u2764\ufe0f"}, {"role": "user", "content": "happy to have met y\u2019all!! thanks for organizing the airbnb Sav and thanks for brining all the good vibes and energy all weekend long everyone \ud83d\ude0a"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It was so fun meeting everyone!!

It\u2019s reminiscent of a more recent memoir, Educated, and is filled with parental malpractices that are very concerning - think neglect, alcoholism, starvation. The family's relationship is complex, layered with both love and resentment. For years, the father continuously promises his kids that he'll build them a glass castle to live in, but Jeannette knows this is nothing but a pipe dream. \n\nI found the story to be captivating and inspirational. She writes in a matter-of-fact way that keeps the tone light-hearded rather than depressing, and there's no lamenting -just pure determination and resilience. The book truly puts things into perspective, since all of my basic needs on Maslow's Hierarchy are met. And spoiler: Jeanette's are not, and yet she goes on to achieve undisputed success, supporting herself through college and graduating from Columbia. New York becomes a place where she can escape poverty and create the life she wants.

The poets were either worshipped by the sultan or skinned alive by him. \n\nThey were also gay. Very, very gay. Looking at you Ahmed Pasha. \n\nTears of blood, wine drunkedness, the 'twisted dark curl' and the cheek hair of the 'beloved' (who was more often than not, a prepubescent boy) were topics as relevant and prevelant as \"bad bitches\" and \"traplords\" are today."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Le gust\u00f3 \u201c\nThe Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls is a memoir ab\u2026\u201d"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Happy Monday!

I think this book was an interesting read and spoke to a subject I hadn\u2019t spent much time on in the past.

Animal domestication and population density begat diseases, which in turn begat immunity to said diseases. Those same populations wtih access to consistent food had more time to cataylze technology. So if you are an isolated population, you are already at a disadvantage, as the proliferation of agriculture and animal domestication across geography was extremely rare. I think it\u2019s worthy of its decades of praise, but it basically forgoes spirituality and consciousness, which are so essential to being human, community, and society.
