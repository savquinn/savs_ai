Don\u2019t give them my name because Shannon and Santiago are the ones who gave the gate permission to let you in.\n\n You must enter Indian Palms at the gate (48630 Monroe Street, Indio).\u00a0\u00a0Once through the gate your GPS will lead you to the house at 82703 Redford Way. You can also get a map from the gate attendant. Redford Way is in the newer part of Indian Palms. \n\nDue to the concerts, the front gate will be max out getting people in so please be patient. Once you are in and have a pass I believe they will allow you to enter and exit the Jackson street gate. That gate is to your left as you face the house. It is two stop signs down.\n\nHouse access:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Open front door using Schlage Code Entry: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad. Then type in 1967, electronic lock engages (clicks), however, you will need to manually turn the knob to release deadbolt. \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To lock front door using Schlage Code Entry System: Push the top button (Schlage), this lights up and activates keypad, electronic lock engages (clicks), manually turn the knob to lock deadbolt. (please make sure, deadbolt engaged and door is locked) No need to use code to lock.\n\nWhen you enter the house there will be note book of house instructions in a basket on the entry table. In the basket are keys, a garage door opener and a remote for the patio lights. \nPlease make sure you put all of your trash in the cans on the garage\u00a0\u00a0side of the house. \n\nThere are cans for trash and recyclables. There are extra trash bags in the laundry room. Trash is picked up on Monday. Please put the cans with your trash on the sidewalk next to the fire hydrant. Make sure the recyclable large can is not over 70 lbs.\n\nThey are allowing overnight parking in the street for the concerts. You can park 2 cars in the garage and 2 in the drive so you should be good.\n\nThe pool will be heated to 85 degrees. Please don\u2019t turn the heat beyond 85 because it is very expensive to heat. The spa is set for 100 degrees. When you switch the heater to spa mode it takes about 45 minutes to heat. All of the operating instructions for the pool equipment is in the house instructions notebook. When you are through using the spa make sure you turn the values back to pool setting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you have any problems don't hesitate to call\u00a0\u00a0or text me Shannon or Santiago.\n\nWe have excellent neighbors but I would ask that you keep the noise level down when you return from the concert.\n\nYou can check in anytime after noon and please check out by noon on Monday.\n\nAbsolutely no glitter in the house or outside. We had a horrific experience two years ago with glitter and the cleaning cost were astronomical\n\nTHANK YOU for booking and have fun at Coachella! Let me know if you have any further questions. Text or call your host,\u00a0\u00a0Shannon Mendez \u2013 (858) 242-0811or Santiago Mendez \u2013 (858) 254-1337\n\nLarry"}]}
