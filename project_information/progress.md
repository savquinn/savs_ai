Let me analyze the current state of your project:


Search files...
Based on the codebase analysis, here's a summary of your project's current progress:

1. **Data Pipeline (Completed)**
   - âœ… `extract_raw.py`: Extracts messages from chat.db
   - âœ… `clean_data.py`: Cleans messages and groups into conversations
   - âœ… `prepare_training.py`: Prepares data for fine-tuning
   - Current stats:
     - 5,720 total messages
     - 478 conversations
     - 5,220 messages with text
     - 500 empty messages

2. **Fine-tuning Infrastructure (Completed)**
   - âœ… Base fine-tuning framework
   - âœ… OpenAI fine-tuning implementation
   - âœ… Training data preparation with:
     - System prompts tailored to your style
     - Full conversations and message pairs formats
     - Training/validation split functionality

3. **Model Training (Ready to Start)**
   - âœ… Configuration system for different model providers
   - âœ… Example fine-tuning script (`fine_tune_example.py`)
   - âœ… Support for:
     - GPT-3.5-turbo fine-tuning
     - Custom system prompts
     - Hyperparameter configuration

4. **MVP Features (In Progress)**
   - âœ… Data processing pipeline
   - âœ… Fine-tuning infrastructure
   - ðŸš§ Private hosting (not started)
   - ðŸš§ Authentication system (not started)
   - ðŸš§ RLHF feedback system (not started)

5. **Next Steps**
   1. Run the fine-tuning process using your prepared data
   2. Set up the private hosting infrastructure
   3. Implement authentication
   4. Create the RLHF feedback system

Would you like to proceed with any of these next steps? I can help you:
1. Start the fine-tuning process with your current data
2. Begin setting up the private hosting infrastructure
3. Work on the authentication system
4. Design the RLHF feedback system

Let me know which aspect you'd like to focus on next!
